Problem analysis: Sum

Problem:
	Create a program that allows you to input two integers
	and have the sum of them output.

Error Condition:
	Cannot enter a double into the integer field.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.
	Cannot enter a fraction into the integer field.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.
	Cannot enter variables or any function into the input field,
	even if the answer is an int.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.

Test Cases:
	Input:
		1) 3 and 5
		2) -8 and 4
		3) -8 and -2
		4) 3*2 and 2
		5) 4/8 and 5
	Expected Output:
		1) Sum: 8
		2) Sum: -4
		3) Sum: -10
		4) That is not an integer
		5) That is not an integer
	Output:
		1) Sum: 8
		2) Sum: -4
		3) Sum: -10
		4) That is not an integer
		5) That is not an integer

Problem Analysis: Poly

Problem:
	Create a program that will ask the user to take 3 roots
	and display the polynomial.

Error Conditions:
	Cannot enter a double into the integer field.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.

	Cannot enter a fraction into the integer field.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.

	Cannot enter variables or any function into the input field,
	even if the answer is an int.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.

Test Cases:
	Inputs:
		1) 3, 5, and 8
		2) 4, 5, and 6
		3) 3*3, 4, and 8
		4) 3.42, 6, and 12

	Expected Outputs:
		1) The polynomial is: x^3 + -16x^2 + 79x + -120
		2) The polynomial is: x^3 + -15x^2 + 74x + -120
		3) That is not an integer. Enter again:
		4) That is not an integer. Enter again:
	Output:
		1) The polynomial is: x^3 + -16x^2 + 79x + -120
		2) The polynomial is: x^3 + -15x^2 + 74x + -120
		3) That is not an integer. Enter again:
		4) That is not an integer. Enter again:

Problem Analysis: Intersect

Problem: Write a program that will ask the user for 5 variable inputs
	and use those variables to input into a linear and quadratic function.
	Then, find and output the intercept of the two functions.

Error Conditions:
	Cannot enter a double into the integer field.
		Fix: changes the variables to doubles

	Cannot enter a fraction into the integer field.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.

	Cannot enter variables or any function into the input field,
	even if the answer is an int.
		Fix: the IO module resolves this by indictating that the input
		is not an int.

	Int d could be 0, which make the quadratic function turn into a linear
	function, leading to either infinite interceptions or no interceptions.
		Fix: if statement for when d==0 and then conditions nested under
		to address if the y-intercept of both functions are the same or
		if they are different.

	If there are no real solutions, 2 solutions, or one solution. Code needs to
	indicate this to display the right information.
		Fix: Created variable u to calculate the discriminant, which
		will algebraically show whether or not if there was no real solution,
		two real solutions, or only one real solution.

Test Cases:
	Inputs:
		1) 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
		2) 0, 4, 7, 3, and 3
		3) 0, 4, 5, 4, and 5
		4) 0, 4, 5, 5, and 7
		5) 1, -2, 40, -2, and 3
	Expected Output:
		1) The intersections are: (1.0,15.0) (-0.5,4.5)
		2) The intersection is: (-4.0,-9.0)
		3) These two equations intersect forever :D!
		4) The intersection is: (-2.0,-3.0)		
		5) none
	Output:
		1) The intersections are: (1.0,15.0) (-0.5,4.5)
		2) The intersection is: (-4.0,-9.0)
		3) These two equations intersect forever :D!
		4) The intersection is: (-2.0,-3.0)		
		5) none
